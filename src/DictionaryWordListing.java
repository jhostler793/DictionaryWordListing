 /*You are to a write a program which asks a user to enter 10 words.  Save these words in an array.  Using the bubble sort algorithm
 (see below), sort the words in an ascending order. For the output, print out the words in the original order, in the ascending order,
 and in the descending order. Finally, print an array where all letters have been changed to uppercase. Don't forget to write a pseudocode
 or flowchart BEFORE writing your code.

Your output should look something like this:

Enter 10 words: kiwi pineapple apple banana orange grapes watermelon cherry strawberry melon

Original Order:
kiwi pineapple apple banana orange grapes watermelon cherry strawberry melon

Alphabetical Order:
apple banana cherry grapes kiwi melon orange pineapple strawberry watermelon

Reversed Alphabetical Order:
watermelon strawberry pineapple orange melon kiwi grapes cherry banana apple

Upper case array:
APPLE BANANA CHERRY GRAPES KIWI MELON ORANGE PINEAPPLE STRAWBERRY WATERMELON
